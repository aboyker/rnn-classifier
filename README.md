# rnn-classifier

## Motivations

This is a TensorFlow implementation of a RNN classifier with GRU units. Everything is designed 'from scratches', that is we do not use the high level layers/units classes of TensorFlow so that we can keep control over every tensor operation.

## Default dataset

As an example, we use the STSA dataset. This data set can be used for sentiment analysis (binary classification)
